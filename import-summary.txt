ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* OWNERS
* README
* ant.properties
* build.xml
* start_loopback_stubbed_camera_saved_video_out.py
* third_party/
* third_party/.DS_Store
* third_party/autobanh/
* third_party/autobanh/.DS_Store
* third_party/autobanh/BUILD.gn
* third_party/autobanh/LICENSE
* third_party/autobanh/LICENSE.md
* third_party/autobanh/NOTICE
* third_party/autobanh/lib/
* third_party/autobanh/lib/autobanh.jar

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/org/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/org/.DS_Store
* src/org/appspot/.DS_Store => app/src/main/resources/org/appspot/.DS_Store
* /Users/kolenyov/Development/src/examples/androidtests/src/ => app/src/androidTest/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
